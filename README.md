INTRODUCTION

Encryption is one of the best tools at protecting data when it comes to computer security. There are many forms of encryption as well. One of the basic yet effective  form that I encountered recently in my work is Caesar Cipher Encryption. What exactly is Caesar Cipher Encryption?
Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in  the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions  down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence. In this project we will start with the discussion about the Caesar Cipher then move forward with the environment used for the implementation and with procedure been Implemented to achieve data security.

PROBLEM DEFINITION:

Caesarâ€™s cipher shifts each letter by a number of letters. If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, just rotate back to the front of the alphabet. In the case of a rotation by 3, w, x, y and z would map to z, a, b and c.
